# Internship Paperwork Automation Tool

This desktop application was developed in C# for the International and Internship Office at the School of Telecommunication Engineering. It is designed to help students easily prepare and submit all necessary documents required to process an academic internship. The application allows students to upload their personal and internship-related data, and in return, it automatically generates a checklist and provides all the required documents for official internship processing.

## ✨ Key Features

  - Personal information
  - Internship details
- Automatic generation of required documents:
  - Internship agreement (convenio)
  - Budget commitment form (compromiso presupuestario)
  - Accident insurance form
  - General data summary

## 🛠️ Built With
